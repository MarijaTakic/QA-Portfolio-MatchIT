# QA-portfolio-
 This is my QA-portfolio! It is a manual testing project of the "MatchIT" application. 
<hr>

Match IT is a platform that makes it easier for candidates to search for a job in the IT sector. It is also known as "Tinder for employment".

In this repository, you can see about my work on this application. The documents contained in the portfolio are Improvements, Bug reports and Test cases.
