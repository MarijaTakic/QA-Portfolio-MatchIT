# QA-Portfolio-MatchIT
 Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This is a manual testing project of the "MatchIT" application. 
<hr>

**Project**

MatchIT is a platform that makes it easier for candidates to search for a job in the IT sector. It is also known as "Tinder for employment".

I had the opportunity to test both the mobile and web applications. You can see a summary of my contribution to the app here.
The main tasks were:

*Writing improvements (visual and functional)

*Searching for errors and writing bug reports (using google devtools as well)

*Writing test cases

*Writing a test run report
<hr>

**Testing**

Testing multiple pages on the app (mobile and web app) allowed me to get to know the app itself better. All the errors I found were documented through bug reports. I also presented my suggestions for improvements to the application, both functional and visual.
